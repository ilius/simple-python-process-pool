I was trying to use multiprocessing.Pool in a project recently, and couple
things were giving me problems, most notably that it hangs if the user presses
Ctrl+C.  Here's a homegrown implementation of a process queue that should
handle KeyboardInterrupt gracefully.

It also doesn't allow pending processes to start after the pool is "closed".
This may or may not be what you want.
